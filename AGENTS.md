# AGENTS — dmf-init

Day-0 stateless init/bootstrap container for the DMF Platform (React + FastAPI). See README.md and CLAUDE.md for repo specifics; cross-repo context —
status, decisions, plans — lives in the
[dmfdeploy umbrella repo](https://github.com/dmfdeploy/dmfdeploy), checked out
as a sibling directory of this repo.

## Working model (mandatory)

Canonical: [docs/WORKING-MODEL.md](https://github.com/dmfdeploy/dmfdeploy/blob/main/docs/WORKING-MODEL.md)
in the umbrella repo. The three rules that matter mid-task:

1. **Work starts at an issue** in the canonical backlog
   ([dmfdeploy/dmfdeploy issues](https://github.com/dmfdeploy/dmfdeploy/issues);
   milestone + `component:*`/`workstream:*` labels). Non-trivial work gets a
   plan doc in umbrella `docs/plans/` with `tracking_issue` frontmatter.
2. **The completing PR auto-closes its issue; you still flip the plan
   frontmatter by hand in that PR.** Reference umbrella issues **fully
   qualified** — `Closes dmfdeploy/dmfdeploy#N` (bare `#N` targets the wrong
   repo); the daily issue-close reconciler honors that ref, cross-repo
   included. Manual close is a fallback.
3. **Never invent a local backlog** (TODO files, ad-hoc trackers). Issues =
   liveness; plan frontmatter = design state; ADRs = decisions (RFC in
   Discussions first); STATUS.md = committed notes; STATUS.local.md = live repo snapshot.
